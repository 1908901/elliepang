    "\n",
    "Bubble Sort: First, take the first two numbers, 75 and 17, and since 75 is greater than 17, it swaps places with the 17. Then, it compares 75 and 46 as the second and third numbers of the list, and it is swapped again. Once it goes next to the 80, it does not get swapped this time because 75 is smaller than 80. It continues this check and swap method through the whole list.\n",
    "Selection Sort: To sort the list [75, 17, 46, 80, 67, 45, 69, 79, 40, 0] using Selection Sort, we start by finding the minimum element (0) and swapping it with the first element (75). Then, we find the minimum element from the remaining unsorted part and swap it with the second element (17). This process continues until the entire list is sorted. The final sorted list is [0, 17, 40, 45, 46, 67, 69, 75, 79, 80].\n",

    "[88, 39, 53, 39, 58, 43, 74, 81, 71, 51]\n",
    "\n",
    "How would you sort this list with...\n",
    "\n",
    "Merge Sort: To sort the list [88, 39, 53, 39, 58, 43, 74, 81, 71, 51] using Merge Sort, we follow a divide-and-conquer approach. First, we recursively divide the list into smaller sublists until each sublist contains only one element. Then, we merge these sublists in a sorted manner. To merge two sublists, we compare the elements from each sublist and place them in the correct order. We continue this process until all the sublists are merged into a single sorted list. Applying Merge Sort to the given list, the final sorted list is [39, 39, 43, 51, 53, 58, 71, 74, 81, 88].\n",
    "Insertion Sort: Insertion Sort is a simple sorting algorithm that works by iteratively building a sorted portion of the list. Starting with the second element, it compares each element with the ones before it and inserts it at the correct position by shifting elements to the right. This process is repeated for each subsequent element until the entire list is sorted. When applying Insertion Sort to the list [88, 39, 53, 39, 58, 43, 74, 81, 71, 51], the final sorted list is [39, 39, 43, 51, 53, 58, 71, 74, 81, 88].\n"
