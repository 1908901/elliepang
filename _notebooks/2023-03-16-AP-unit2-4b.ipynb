    "The portion of the code that has been compromised checks to see if the user-entered new password is less than two characters in length. The message variable is set to \"hacked\" and the password variable is set to \"gothackednewpassword123\" if the length is less than 2. This implies that if someone tries to set a simple or brief password, a harder password will be automatically provided to them.\n",

    "\n",
    "A control flow statement for handling errors is try/except. The try block's function is run, and if an error is made, control is instantly passed to the except block. The program is able to carry on by handling the error in the unless block and catching it. Try/except is helpful when you anticipate a piece of code might result in an error but don't want the program to crash if it does. Instead, you should gracefully manage the error and carry on with the remainder of the application.\n",

    "- What code seems to be repeated in each of these examples to point, why is it repeated?\n",
