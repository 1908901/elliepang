    "Because it takes advantage of the fact that data is sorted, binary search is more effective than sequential search. Binary search significantly reduces the number of comparisons necessary by continually halving the search space, eliminating a sizable fraction of the remaining components at each comparison. Sequential search, on the other hand, looks at each element individually until a match is discovered, which makes it less effective for large datasets."
