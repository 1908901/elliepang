    "In this example code, we first import the necessary libraries, including NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib. We then load the CSV file into a Pandas DataFrame using the pd.read_csv() function. We print the first 5 rows of the DataFrame using the df.head() function. Next, we calculate the mean, median, and standard deviation of the 'MPG' column using the appropriate Pandas methods, and print the results. And, we create a histogram of the 'MPG' column using Matplotlib by calling the plt.hist() function and setting appropriate axis labels and a title. We then call the plt.show() method to display the plot. Even though NumPy is not directly used in this code, it is an important underlying component of the pandas and Matplotlib libraries, which are used to load, manipulate and visualize data. It allows them to work more efficiently"

    "#### Summary/Goals of Lesson:\n",
    "One of our goals was to make you understand data analysis and how it can be important in optimizing business performance. We also wanted to make sure you understood the use of Pandas and NumPy libraries in data analysis, with a focus on NumPy. As someone who works with data, we find Pandas incredibly useful for manipulating, analyzing, and visualizing data in Python. The way we use pandas is to calculate individual player and team statistics. We are a group that works with numerical data, so NumPy is one of our favorite tools for working with arrays and applying mathematical functions to them. It is very fast at computing and manipulating arrays making it a very valuable tool for tracking statistics which is important to our group. For example, if you have an array of the points scored by each player in a game, you can use NumPy to calculate the total points scored, average points per player, or the highest and lowest scoring players.\n",

    "- The Python package NumPy is used for numerical computation. It enables users to efficiently manipulate and run mathematical operations on massive multi-dimensional arrays. Because it can quickly complete computations and handle enormous datasets, NumPy is frequently used in data analysis.\n",

    "\n",
    "What is Pandas and how is it used in data analysis?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Pandas is a Python library for analyzing and manipulating data. To work with structured data, such as tables, it offers data structures and operations. When performing data analysis, Pandas is frequently used to import data, clean and transform it, examine and summarize the data, carry out complex operations, and produce insights. It is used across many industries and makes the process of data analysis simpler.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "How is NunPy different than Pandas for data analysis?\n",
    "\n",
    "- The multi-dimensional array operations offered by NumPy are effective and are focused on numerical computing.On the other hand, Pandas is based on NumPy and adds more features designed exclusively for data analysis. It offers high-level data structures that can manage structured data with labeled columns and rows, like dataframes.\n",
    "\n",

    "What is a DataFrame?\n",
