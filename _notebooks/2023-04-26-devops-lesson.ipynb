    "2. What is the purpose of DNS?\n",

    "3. How does DNS work?\n",
    "\n",
    "When you enter a domain name into your web browser, such as www.googledocs.com, your computer asks a DNS server for the IP address that corresponds to that domain name. The IP address linked to the domain name is then found in the DNS server's database and sent back to your machine. Following that, your computer connects to the server hosting the website you requested using that IP address.\n",

    "4. What is a DNS resolver?\n",
    "\n",
    "It is a computer program or service that aids your device in locating the IP address connected to a desired internet domain name. The DNS resolver converts a domain name you enter into a corresponding IP address so that your device may connect to the correct server and show the website or other online resource you requested when you input it into your web browser.\n",

    "1. Explain what CORS is and what it stands for\n",
    "\n",
    "CORS stands for Cross-Origin Resource Sharing. It is a security feature implemented in web browsers that allows servers to specify which domains are allowed to access their resources and which requests are allowed to access those resources. It is designed to prevent malicious scripts from executing in a user's browser by blocking unauthorized cross-domain requests.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Describe how you would be able to implement CORS into your own websites\n",
    "\n",
    "- to implement CORS in a website, the server needs to set appropriate headers in its response to requests. The header \"Access-Control-Allow-Origin\" is used to specify which domains are allowed to access the resources. For example, if a server wants to allow access from all domains, it can set the header to \"*\". If it only wants to allow access from a specific domain, it can set the header to that domain. Additionally, the server can specify which HTTP methods and headers are allowed to be used in cross-origin requests.\n",

    "3. Describe why you would want to implement CORS into your own websites\n",
    "\n",
    "- CORS is important to implement in a website to protect the user's data and prevent unauthorized access to resources. It allows a server to control which domains can access its resources, which prevents malicious scripts from executing in a user's browser. By implementing CORS, a website can also allow third-party domains to access its resources, which is necessary for some features, such as embedding videos or accessing APIs.\n",

    "- using CORS can benefit website owners by allowing them to provide better user experiences and more secure websites. For example, by allowing third-party domains to access resources, a website can provide more features and integrate with other services. Additionally, by implementing CORS, website owners can protect user data and prevent unauthorized access to resources, which can help build trust with users and improve the overall security of the website.\n",

In order to deploy KASM, one would need to have knowledge of how to configure a server, set up network connections, and ensure proper security measures are in place.
