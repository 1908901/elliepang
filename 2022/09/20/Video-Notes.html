<p>Takeaways from the video:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Takeaways from the video:
• I’m going to start doing everyday activities that make me happy, even if it takes a lot of effort,
since, as the video showed, pleasure comes from living in the present rather than in the past or
the future.
• I’ll make an effort to socialize more, interact with others, and become involved in groups.
• I’ll always make a point of telling the individuals I love how much I value them and work to
strengthen my bonds with others. n
• I won’t explicitly concentrate on the future; instead, I’ll concentrate on the present and now and
what I can do, all the options and the choices I can make now to make me happy and live a
more fulfilled life.</li>
