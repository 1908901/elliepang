# Notes 

- In class we learned how to use bash and python such as python functions if/else statements and variables. 
- We learned about keys and that bash can make scripts with terminal/shell. 
- Static Text do not change.
- Output in Jupyter Notebook is under the code cell. It will vary based on development intentions and tools.
- Sequence of code: two or more lines forms a sequence.
- "Msg": parameter to print command, causing input to be output to terminal.
- Procedural abstraction: grouping a sequence of commands.
