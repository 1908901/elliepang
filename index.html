We shared many files in conjunction with brief overviews that shared a lot of learning, understanding, and experiments. The API not updated is probably a result of configuration posted to update Nginx configuration to allow PUT. I believe I posted solution. Involvement and participation by everyone was strong. Ideas seem strong as well.|
|11|Project Week 3|[Hacks](https://github.com/LoveMyDogs/teamcheesep3t8/issues/2#issue-1436334028)|For our program, our group created a quiz integrated with the Fastpages browsing system.The program uses questions and answers generated in a random order from an API to create a quiz, and the API itself is located in the backend of the program. It also logs data in the form of points and presents these points at the end of the quiz, for correct and incorrect answers. We also included another API in the form of a survey that collects the data and stores it; a table is used for this.|
