<p>Overall, I think that my scoring and collegeboard’s were pretty much the same. When I create my own create task I think it will be very important to not only meet every criterion but also to have a little more than what is required. This way, if collegeboard thinks that one of the lists (example) I have doesn’t manage complexity, I will still have other lists that could fill this gap. In addition, I think that I will have to be very specific in my write-up and answer the questions precisely.</p>
