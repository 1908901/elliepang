## Submission One

|Reporting Category|Student Score|College Board Score|Comments|
|Program Purpose and Function|0|0|The student met all the criteria with their project (input, program functionality, and output) but did not describe the purpose of their function, just what their program is without elaborating.|
|Data Abstraction| 0 | 1 | I saw that the data was not contained in animalList.|
|Managing Complexity| 0 | 0 | The user didn't explain how code would be different without the list and doesn't have complexity, Collegeboard also says that, "neither contain code using a list. The code is not complex."| 
|Procedural Abstraction| 1 | 1 | The user does include a parameter but fails to explain overall functionality of the procedure.|
|Algorithm Implementation with specific variables| 1 | 1 |the user doesn't explain how the algorithm could be recreated as the description is very minimal although they do include iteration, sequencing, and selection.|
|Testing| 1 | 1 | The submission includes different examples of inputs and explains the results and how they are different.|

## Submission Two

|Reporting Category|Student Score|College Board Score|Comments|
|Program Purpose and Function|0|1|the student explains both the purpose of his program ("explore creativity") and how it functions, they also explain how the output will change based on user input.|
|Data Abstraction| 0 | 1 |the student explains and identifies a list (nounList) and explains how it functions in fulfilling the programs purpose (so that the program makes logical sense)|
|Managing Complexity| 0 | 1 | This gets the point because the response explains how complexity is managed and explains how the program would be different if the list was not used, he explains how the code would be less efficient and more cluttered.| 
|Procedural Abstraction| 1 | 1 | the response identifies the procedure createPoems and explains how it contributes to the overall functionality. They also has at least one parameter, they use 4 parameters.|
|Algorithm Implementation with specific variables| 1 | 1 |I agree with CB because the response includes selection, sequencing, and iteration as well as in depth explanations for each. The response also explains how the algorithm could be recreated.|
|Testing| 1 | 1 | The response explains the different conditions and shows how different inputs result in different outputs.|

## Submission Three

|Reporting Category|Student Score|College Board Score|Comments|
|Program Purpose and Function|0|1|the student explains both the purpose of his program ("explore creativity") and how it functions, they also explain how the output will change based on user input.|
|Data Abstraction| 0 | 0 |the response fails to explain the overall function, such as for entertainment. However, they meet every other requirement with explanations of function, input and output.|
|Managing Complexity| 0 | 0 | They explain how they manage complexity, "Using lists allows the data to be stored, accessed, and manipulated in an easier, cleaner-looking way." The response explains how the character can be stored in one variable instead of seven, which is much more efficient, condensed coding. Therefore, they received the point.| 
|Procedural Abstraction| 1 | 0 |the response explains how the function works and how contributes to overall functionality of the program. Collegeboard also says that, "Using lists allows the data to be stored, accessed, and manipulated in an easier, cleaner-looking way.|
|Algorithm Implementation with specific variables| 1 | 0 |I agree with CB because the response includes explanation of iteration, sequencing, and selection and shows how the algorithm could be recreated. There are also two parameters identified.|
|Testing| 1 | 0 | the response explains two different conditions and calls, which shows how different inputs will result in different outputs.|

## Submission Four

|Reporting Category|Student Score|College Board Score|Comments|
|Program Purpose and Function|0|0|this response successfully addresses every requirement, with a purpose (test critical thinking), overall function, and input and output explanations.|
|Data Abstraction| 1 | 1 |the student explains and identifies a list (guesses) and explains what's in the list, but doesn't explain overall function or purpose of the list. Collegeboard had similar ideas but didn't mention purpose, they said "in the second code segment, data stored in the list is not being used; only the length of the list is accessed. So the response does not meet this criteria."|
|Managing Complexity| 1 | 1 | The response doesn't get the point because they do not explain how the code could be written differently. CB says, "The use of the list is merely to act as a counter, so it can be replaced with a single counter variable."| 
|Procedural Abstraction| 1 | 1 |the response explains how the function works and how contributes to overall functionality of the program. Student developed procedure (isitcorrect) and has a parameter.|
|Algorithm Implementation with specific variables| 1 | 1 |I agree with CB because the response includes explanation of iteration, sequencing, and selection and shows how the algorithm could be recreated.|
|Testing| 1 | 1 | I disagreed with CB at first since the response had two different calls that have different outputs based on the input. CB says that "The response gives the conditions being tested rather than two different arguments that cause a different segment of code to execute. Arguments should be specific values used in the call to the procedure."|

Overall, I think that my scoring and collegeboard’s were pretty much the same. When I create my own create task I think it will be very important to not only meet every criterion but also to have a little more than what is required. This way, if collegeboard thinks that one of the lists (example) I have doesn’t manage complexity, I will still have other lists that could fill this gap. In addition, I think that I will have to be very specific in my write-up and answer the questions precisely.
