## Submission One

|Reporting Category|Student Score|College Board Score|Comments|
|Program Purpose and Function|1|0|The student did not meet the requirement because it does not fit the purpose of the task and is not specific in their response|
|Data Abstraction| 1 | 1 | I thought that their response was thorough and easy to understand and met all of the guidelines|
|Managing Complexity| 0 | 1 | It was slightly confusing to me when reading their response, however collegeboard gave them a higher score. I looked back at the rubric and concluded that their score was accurate from collegeboard. 
|Procedural Abstraction| 1 | 1 | I agree with collegeboard because I thought their response met all the guidelines and was very easy to understand.|
|Algorithm Implementation with specific variables | 1 | 1 | I gave the student the same score as collegeboard. After reviewing the rubric, I thought that this student met the guidelines with no issues.|
|Testing| 1 | 1 | I agree with collegeboard because I thought their response met all the guidelines and was very easy to understand.

## Submission two 

|Reporting Category|Student Score|College Board Score|Comments|
|Program Purpose and Function|0|0|The response was unclear and did not meet the guidelines and collegeboard agreed.|
|Data Abstraction| 1 | 0 | I thought that their response was thorough and easy to understand and met all of the guidelines|
|Managing Complexity| 0 | 1 | I agree with collegeboard because I thought their response met all the guidelines and was very easy to understand.| 
|Procedural Abstraction| 1 | 1 | I agree with collegeboard because I thought their response met all the guidelines and was very easy to understand.|

|Testing| 1 | 1 | I agree with collegeboard because I thought their response met all the guidelines and was very easy to understand.|

Overall, I think that my scoring and collegeboard's were pretty much the same. When I create my own create task I think it will be very important to not only meet every criterion but also to have a little more than what is required. This way, if collegeboard thinks that one of the lists (example) I have doesn't manage complexity, I will still have other lists that could fill this gap. In addition, I think that I will have to be very specific in my write-up and answer the questions precisely.
