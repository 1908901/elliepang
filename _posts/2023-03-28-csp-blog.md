# Reflection from Presentation

The panel was really fascinating and informative. Graduates of Cal State San Marcos, John and Ashley, the speakers, described many STEM-related aspects of their university and programs. They provide information and advise on how to participate in and excel in some of the programs and studies that are offered at CSUSM. With my interest in STEM, I will use their advice. The final activity was also a lot of fun and interesting. I feel that this panel provided me with a wealth of new information, insights, and resources regarding STEM in higher education.
