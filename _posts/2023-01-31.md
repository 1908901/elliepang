## My Portion of Project for CPT

For our Fluffy Friend Finder project, my portion of the project is going to be a pet diagnoser under the vet section. The user will input the symptoms that their pet has and the program will diagnose the dog, recommend the owner to a veternarian, and give suggestions for treatment. 

## Video Plan
In my video I will show the user completing a quiz/survey that asks about the pet's symptoms. After submiting, the user will receive their pet's diagnoses, treament, and recommendations for professional help.
