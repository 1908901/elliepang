## APCSP Project: Journal

I watched a group's presentation for their final project and I was really amazed by their final product. Their project was a journal that had had a text box to write your thoughts, buttons to rate your emotions or how your day was going, and had a really nice design.

I was really impressed by all of the projects in the room but I especially loved this colorful on. I could tell that the artist took a lot of time on their project and their final result was really great to look at.

I found all of these projects to be really cool. I thought about how much time it took to design and execute their plan into their final project and the results were cool.
