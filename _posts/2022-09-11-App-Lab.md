| The theme of my quiz is volleyball. I will have three questions with 4 possible answers each. When the user clicks the incorrect answer, a sound will play and an red "incorrect" text will show. When the correct answer is clicked, a different sound will play and the quiz will continue to the next question. By the end  of the quiz, it will collect the number of wrong and right answers and the calculate the score. To execute this, I will have a screen for the title, question one, question two, question three, and score results.| After coding, most of my planned executed successfully. I figured out how to put a certain amount of time for each event, how to use buttons, and calculate the score. The quiz adds up the total amount of points and then totals them to get the final score| Something that was successful for me was that the code on code.org is pretty simple and straightforward. Something that I found difficult was managing all of the buttons and screens since I had so many of each.|
