| The theme of my quiz is volleyball. I will have three questions with 4 possible answers each. When the user clicks the incorrect answer, a sound will play and an red "incorrect" text will show. When the correct answer is clicked, a different sound will play and the quiz will continue to the next question. By the end  of the quiz, it will collect the number of wrong and right answers and the calculate the score. To execute this, I will have a screen for the title, question one, question two, question three, and score results.| After coding, most of my planned executed successfully. I figured out how to put a certain amount of time for each event, how to use buttons, and calculate the score. The quiz adds up the total amount of points and then totals them to get the final score| Something that was successful for me was that the code on code.org is pretty simple and straightforward. Something that I found difficult was managing all of the buttons and screens since I had so many of each.|

## Row 1: Program Purpose and Function
The code starts simple with onEvents that set to a specific screen if the user clicks on a specific button.  Later in the  code I use if then and if else  code to simplify the code and can used the blocks to calculate the score in a percentage. 

## Row 2: Data Abstraction 
I learned more about javascript and how to code through coding blocks and learned how to store different types of code. The code can limit the input that a person can give.  

## Row 3: Managing Complexity 
The code compares data and work simliar to MBTI tests to ask you a question and get feedback such as the score to get your results. 

## Row 4: Procedural Abstraction
The procedural is storing data through the person's input contributes to the results of the program and depending on the results, the program can grade what you go on the website.

## Row 5: Algorithm Implementation 
The algorithm will be based on their results and what choices they choose from the 3 questions. The program will calculate your score and then grade you, it can also show if you got it right or wrong. 

## Row 6: Testing
I would normally do this on a video like they do for AP exams, but if you test out my website in the link below, you would know that it would work and that it shows the following commands that I put in.
