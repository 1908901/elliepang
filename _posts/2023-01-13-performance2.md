## Submission One

|Program Purpose and Function|0|0|The student met all the criteria with their project (input, program functionality, and output) but did not describe the purpose of their function, just what their program is without elaborating.|
|Data Abstraction| 0 | 0 | I saw that the data was not contained in animalList|
|Managing Complexity| 0 | 1 | It was slightly confusing to me when reading their response, however collegeboard gave them a higher score. I looked back at the rubric and concluded that their score was accurate from collegeboard. 
|Procedural Abstraction| 1 | 1 | I agree with collegeboard because I thought their response met all the guidelines and was very easy to understand.|
|Algorithm Implementation with specific variables | 1 | 1 | I gave the student the same score as collegeboard. After reviewing the rubric, I thought that this student met the guidelines with no issues.|
|Testing| 1 | 1 | I agree with collegeboard because I thought their response met all the guidelines and was very easy to understand.
