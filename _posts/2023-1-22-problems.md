# Major Problem of this weeks hacks 

- When doing the api hacks and trying to add a user in postman, I kept getting the error: "name is non-existent or is less than two letters" or ""uid is non-existent or is less than two letters"
- After collaborating with my team and asing questions I changed name, uid, and password to my personal class id's and was able to send changes in postman sucessfully. 
- The image below shows where I changed the variables in the users.py file under the api folder
